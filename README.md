This project applies Machine Learning to predict Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) using clinical data. Classification, regression, and clustering models were tested, identifying BMI, weight, and neck circumference as key factors in predicting the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI).

This project aims to apply Machine Learning techniques for the detection and prediction of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), a disorder characterized by repeated episodes of airway obstruction during sleep. The standard diagnosis is performed through polysomnography, a complex and costly procedure. Therefore, predictive models are proposed to support specialists by using basic clinical data to identify at-risk patients and estimate the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), the main indicator of disease severity.

The database used comes from Quirón Hospital in Málaga and initially included 874 patient records, of which 637 were selected after a cleaning and preprocessing stage. The most relevant variables are age, gender, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), neck circumference, smoking habits, snoring presence, and comorbidities. Missing or inconsistent values were removed, and new features such as BMI were generated to enrich the analysis.

The methodology combined data preparation with exploratory analysis to identify patterns, distributions, and correlations among variables. Afterwards, different supervised and unsupervised models were developed. For classification, algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and random forest were applied to determine whether a patient suffers from OSA. For regression, linear, Ridge, KNN, and tree-based models were used to predict continuous AHI values. In addition, clustering techniques such as K-Means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and Gaussian mixture models were explored to uncover hidden structures in the data. Evaluation was carried out through cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization, using metrics such as Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, MAE, MSE, and Silhouette Score.

The results show that body mass index, neck circumference, and weight are the most relevant predictive features, while gender has little impact. Supervised models achieved solid performance in binary classification (OSA/non-OSA), and clustering methods revealed consistent patient groupings. In conclusion, Machine Learning models show significant potential as a support tool for the clinical diagnosis of sleep apnea, although their accuracy is limited by the size and quality of the dataset. Future work should therefore incorporate larger and more diverse datasets to improve performance.
